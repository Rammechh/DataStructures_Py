## Tree Data Structure
  + [Basics](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/trees)
  + [Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xJvpnenx6Y&list=PLPdtS77PaSutvrLxZJT5gmASGSed0dO_T)
    * 12.17 list to tree 
  + Topics Covered:
    * Create, insert, delete, display, search node, height of tree.
  + Binary Search Tree:
    * Root has max 2 Childs
    * Value of left side child should have less value compared to root
    * Value of right side child should have greater value or equal to root
    * Node data structure has 3 things, left part, data, right part
  + Creating Node:
    * Attached

  + Array representation of binary Tree
    * Nodes in a tree are stored level by level from left to right in an array. If an element is missing leave it blank in array
    * If a node is at index -> i
    * It's left child -> 2i
    * It's right child -> 2i+1
    * Its parent -> i/2
    * pow(2,h+1)-1 elements or nodes
    * height of a complete binary tree will be minimum(log n), unless level is filled not going to next stage

  ### Binary Tree:
  + A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each parent node can have at most two children
  + Types:
  + Full Binary Tree:
    * A full Binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node/internal node has either two or no children
  + Perfect Binary Tree:
    * A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two child nodes and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.
  + Complete Binary Tree: If you represent the tree in an array there will not be any gaps in between 
    * A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with two major differences 1) Every level must be completely filled 2)All the leaf elements must lean towards the left. 3)The last leaf element might not have a right sibling i.e. a complete binary tree doesn't have to be a full binary tree.
