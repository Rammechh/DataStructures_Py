  + Array representation of binary Tree
    * Nodes in a tree are stored level by level from left to right in an array. If an element is missing leave it blank in array
    * If a node is at index -> i
    * It's left child -> 2i
    * It's right child -> 2i+1
    * Its parent -> i/2

  + Topics Covered:
    * Create, insert, delete, display, search node, height of tree.
  + Binary Search Tree:
    * Root has max 2 Childs
    * Value of left side child should have less value compared to root
    * Value of right side child should have greater value or equal to root
    * Node data structure has 3 things, left part, data, right part
  + Creating Node:
    * Attached
